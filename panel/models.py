# AppConf classes depend on being imported during startup of the Django
# process. Even though there are multiple modules loaded automatically, only
# the models modules (usually the models.py file of your app) are guaranteed
# to be loaded at startup. Therefore itâ€™s recommended to put your AppConf
# subclass(es) there, too.
