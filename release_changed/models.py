from django.db import models

from .conf import settings  # noqa

# This is needed due to:
#
# AppConf classes depend on being imported during startup of the Django
# process. Even though there are multiple modules loaded automatically, only
# the models modules (usually the models.py file of your app) are guaranteed
# to be loaded at startup. Therefore it’s recommended to put your AppConf
# subclass(es) there, too.
