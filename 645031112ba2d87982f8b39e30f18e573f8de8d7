      "message": "Indeed, thanks for noticing, adding in patchset 2.\n\n(I don\u0027t know a quick way to test this code, I thought it better to not touch the servers and I don\u0027t know how to test it locally without spending a lot of time trying to learn how to set-up django, the right versions, etc.  And even then, by triggering the actions I might break things in sipwise repos -- e.g. overwriting git tags, docker images.\n\nSo if any of you can test this safely --or tell me how to do it easily-- please go ahead).",

Though the code we\u0027re talking about here isn\u0027t really covered yet and some parts are hard to test as-is.\n\nBroadly speaking: we\u0027ve yet to decide how to proceed with repoapi without having at least one person with good knowledge of python, django, pytest/python-testing in our team, currently we\u0027re just keeping it alive. ;)",

I will wait for your comments before merging.",
